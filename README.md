# Vowel Space Visualizer
An application designed for visualizing vowel spaces. With data acquired from tools like Praat, you can visualize one dataset or compare datasets from different sources—whether across languages or individuals (e.g., two different languages, three individuals).

I developed this program as a creative diversion while getting one of my phonetics homeworks done. The task involved manually inputting data into Excel and adhering to specific guidelines to construct a scatterplot resembling a vowel space. 

I've provided two different scripts for your convenience. The first script is a standalone Python application enabling you to effortlessly generate a vowel space or compare different vowel spaces by inputting the data. The second program, consisting of a Python interface, facilitates the creation of a .csv document containing the entered data. Subsequently, an R script reads this dataset, generating a comprehensive scatterplot based on the provided information.

## Overview

Welcome to the Vowel Space Visualizer! This Python-based application offers a user-friendly interface to create and compare vowel spaces effortlessly. Whether you're a linguistics student or a researcher, this tool provides a convenient way to visualize and analyze the formants of vowels.

## Features

- **Mode Selection**: Choose between creating a vowel space or comparing multiple vowel spaces.

- **Data Input**: Easily input data by pressing the "Add Data" button or using the "Enter" key.

- **Data Correction**: Correct errors by undoing the latest input with the "Undo" button or the "Ctrl (Command) + Z" shortcut.

- **Save Scatterplot**: Save your scatterplot as a JPEG or PNG image using the "Save Scatterplot" function or the "Ctrl (Command) + S" shortcut.

- **Start Fresh**: Use the "Clear Data" function to start over and input new data.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alicagank/vowelspacevisualizer.git
